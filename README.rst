1D Cubic spline interpolation
=====================

A simple example of using some of `GSL's <http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/>`_ C functionality.

Also, its blazingly faster and costs less memory than `Scipy's <http://www.scipy.org/>`_ equivalent.

Run
-------

::

    python setup.py build_ext --inplace

For the example,

::

    python demo.py
